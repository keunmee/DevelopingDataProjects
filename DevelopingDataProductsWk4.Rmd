## Project Objectives :
* To create a Shiny Application : 
1. Create a shiny application with associated supporting documentation   
2. Need to include some widgets, operations on the ui.R and server.R  
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations  
4. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server  

* To create a R Presentation : 
1. 5 slides to pitch the idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter  
2. Need to be pushed to github or Rpubs
